<h2>Avoiding the design rut with <span class="no-break"><strong>HTML and CSS</strong> art.</span></h2>
<p>
  Design gets derivative. The

  we saw a decade ago have now been replaced by those default styles that CSS libraries like Tailwind provide. AI is only making this worse.
</p>
<p>
  One way I keep myself from getting into a derivate design rut is to stretch my thinking&mdash;
  venture somewhere else with the tools I already use.
</p>
<p>
  So, a couple years ago, I decided to marry my childhood love for baseball and art with my grown-up love for code. 
  Given all the new toys that CSS provides today, could I make realistic looking baseball-themed pieces with nothing but raw HTML and CSS?
</p>
<p>
  I started small&mdash;replicating the original two tickets I've still kept from my first Cubs game (my 5th grade teacher gave them away to 
  any student who had perfect attendance that year. He knew the right buttons to push).
</p>
<div class="figure-container smallest reversed">
    <figure>
      <%= image_tag "bb-tickets.png", alt: "Stretching" %>
      <figcaption>
        <span><strong>Perfect game</strong>: A 75 degree Friday afternoon. A $2 hot dog. The Cubs won 15-2. </span>
        <%= render "shared/external_link_button", path: "https://kawaicheung.io/scoreboards/two-for-friday.html", text: "See the real thing!" %>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    The most satisfying part of recreating these tickets was replicating the imperfections of print. 
    The Cubs logo is ever so slightly offset a pixel up-and-to-the-right from its white background. The perforations of the 
    edges are nothing more than a <span class="code">dotted 1px white</span> border, which pops against the <span class="code">box-shadow</span> 
    of the ticket. The tiniest touch of <span class="code">blur</span> on the monospace font makes it look like printed type.
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For these projects, I allowed myself to write imperfect, un-DRY CSS. 
This was about expanding my comfort with the medium.
Ya know, in case you're viewing source ðŸ™‚.
</p>
<p>
  After that, I decided to take it up a few levels. Referencing some old photographs, I replicated these classic baseball scoreboards
  with the same rule: No images. No Javascript. Just pure HTML and CSS.
</p>
<div class="figure-container">
    <figure>
      <%= image_tag "bb-wrigley-1941.png", alt: "Stretching" %>
      <figcaption>
        <span><strong>Wrigley Field, 1941</strong>: Toyed with CSS perspective, hand-cut letters via clip-paths, 
        and made it a windy, rainy day with animation (Wait for it!).</span>
        <%= render "shared/external_link_button", path: "https://kawaicheung.io/scoreboards/wrigley-1941.html", text: "See the real thing!" %>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
     <figure>
      <%= image_tag "bb-comiskey-1978.png", alt: "Stretching" %>
      <figcaption>
        <span><strong>Comiskey Park, 1978</strong>: A complete bastardization of flexbox and CSS grid made for a really fun (and tedious) project.</span>
        <%= render "shared/external_link_button", path: "https://kawaicheung.io/scoreboards/comiskey-1978.html", text: "See the real thing!" %>  
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>With the <%= link_to "Wrigley Field scoreboard", "https://kawaicheung.io/scoreboards/wrigley-1941.html", target: "_blank" %>, I geeked out on all sorts of animation techniques: The rain drops, darkening skies, 
  rotating clock hands, waving flags, and the angle of the shadows against the open areas of the scoreboard.
<p>
  With the <%= link_to "Comiskey Park scoreboard", "https://kawaicheung.io/scoreboards/comiskey-1978.html", target: "_blank" %>, I went a bit nuts on CSS grid. <strong>Every light bulb</strong> is accounted for. They 
  are turned on with the class <span class="code">lit</span>. It was fun to turn on each bulb individually, and leave an 
  occasional one burnt out (An ode to the energy crisis of the 1970s maybe?).
</p>
<p>
  Thinking about CSS in a different context gives me a broader perspective on what we can do with design. 
  We don't always need to rely on imagery or scripting for the fancy stuff.
