<h2>Making <strong>&ldquo;getting things done&rdquo;</strong> easier to do.</h2>
<p>
  The landscape for issue trackers in 2008 was pretty barren. What was there was complex and clunky. 
  So began my 15-year journey into creating, building, and maintaining <strong>DoneDone</strong>. 
  It's been my career pride and joy.
</p>
<p>
  It would be impossible to distill all of that work into one page 
  (and you don't want to read all that!), so I've left 99% of it on the cutting room floor. 
  Here's just a sampling to show you my design and coding approach.

<h3>Marketing Site 1.0 and...5.0</h3>
<p>
  DoneDone's marketing site has gone through about five major redesigns over the years.
  I created the original site and copy as well as the last one before we sold the company.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Important note:</strong> If you go to <%= link_to "DoneDone.com", "https://www.donedone.com/", target: "_blank" %> now, you'll see a 
  version of the marketing site created by the new owners of the product. That is not my work.
