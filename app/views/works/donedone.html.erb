<h2>I built and maintained a product called <strong>DoneDone</strong> for 15 years.</h2>
<p>
  A couple of years into WAM, we needed an issue tracker to manage our consulting projects. 
  The landscape for such tools in 2008 was pretty barren and what was there was complex and clunky. 
  So began my 15-year journey into building an issue tracker called DoneDone.
</p>
<p>DoneDone is my career pride and joy.</p>
<p>
  It would be impossible to distill tens-of-thousands of hours of work, learning, and highs & lows 
  into one page (and even harder to read all that), so Iâ€™ll pull out five things that support
  the stuff I mentioned earlier.
</p>
<h3>(1)Jobs was a huge feature</h3>
<p>
  Involved a re-thinking of all layers...
</p>
<h3>
  (2) Added a Kanban board into the existing product. (Show learning with a video)
</h3>
<p>
  Kanban was a natural fit for DoneDone as an isssue tracker...
</p>
<h3>
  (3) I built a wizard to help folks auto-forward their Gmail address into their DoneDone account. (DELIGHT, surprise)
</h3>
<p>
  Blah
</p>
<h3>
  (3) Between the two of us, Developed our own way spiraling way of creating new features. (Show how much we produced with me doing all design/dev)
  </h3>

  The app is built using Vue and the backend and parts of the frontend architecture are built in .NET (using C# and SQLServer). I know these aren't the tools used at 37signals but 
  having worked with these tools for so long, my eventual move to Ruby on Rails stack was pretty quick and seamless!  
</p>
<p>
  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Since I'd really like this position, I'm going to explain why it's a good thing.
</p>
<p>
  You see, most people are going to come at you with a list of 30 projects they worked on. Parts of this. A little touch of that. 
  The end product may have morphed into something else. What would it have become if they had more autonomy? Better? Worse? Who knows.
</p>
<p>
  I've had the tremendous luxury of conceptualizing an idea with no more than 1 or 2 other people, and then seeing it to fruition.
  That doesn't scare me. I thrive on that.
  </p>
<p>
  I conceptualize. I design. I work on all layers of the stack from the front-end to the database.
  I've managed production infrastructure too (though I don't much like that part).
</p>
<p>
  In fact, for the past 15 years, I worked solely on one pretty large web-based product called DoneDone. 
  It's a task management and shared inbox tool I created in 2008 and.
  The build team was never more than 3 people, and for the past six years, it was, well, just me and my business partner. More on all of this later.
</p>
<p>
  We sold DoneDone in September of 2024.
</p>
<p>
  I think I can be a great teammate.

<p>
  Let me show you an example. For DoneDone, I spent about a month developing an easy way to
  help folks auto-forward their Gmail address into their DoneDone account.
