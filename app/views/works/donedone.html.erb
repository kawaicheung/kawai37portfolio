  The landscape for issue trackers in 2008 was pretty barren. What was there was complex and clunky. 
  So began my 15-year journey into creating, building, and maintaining <strong>DoneDone</strong>. 
  It's been my career pride and joy.

  So here's just a sampling of some of the recent work I'm most proud of.

  <strong>Important note:</strong> If you go to <%= link_to "DoneDone.com", "https://www.donedone.com/", target: "_blank" %> now, you'll see a
