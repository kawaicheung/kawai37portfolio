<h2>I built and maintained one large software product for 15 years.</h2>
<p>
  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Since I'd really like this position, I'm going to explain why it's a good thing.
</p>
<p>
  You see, most people are going to come at you with a list of 30 projects they worked on. Parts of this. A little touch of that. 
  The end product may have morphed into something else. What would it have become if they had more autonomy? Better? Worse? Who knows.
</p>
<p>
  I've had the tremendous luxury of conceptualizing an idea with no more than 1 or 2 other people, and then seeing it to fruition.
  That doesn't scare me. I thrive on that.
  </p>
<p>
  I conceptualize. I design. I work on all layers of the stack from the front-end to the database.
  I've managed production infrastructure too (though I don't much like that part).
</p>
<p>
  In fact, for the past 15 years, I worked solely on one pretty large web-based product called DoneDone. 
  It's a task management and shared inbox tool I created in 2008 and.
  The build team was never more than 3 people, and for the past six years, it was, well, just me and my business partner. More on all of this later.
</p>
<p>
  We sold DoneDone in September of 2024.
</p>
<p>
  I think I can be a great teammate.

  Let me show you an example. For DoneDone, I spent about a month developing an easy way to
  help folks auto-forward their Gmail address into their DoneDone account.
