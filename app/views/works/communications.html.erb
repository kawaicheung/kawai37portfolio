<h2>Speak one. Write one. Draw one.</h2>
<p>
  I love that good communication is a core strength of every 37signals hire. 
  Though I wasn't forward-thinking enough to keep an archive of my
  most epic emails and Basecamp Classic threads, here are a few things I've written, spoken, and illustrated.

<h3><strong>Real Code Series:</strong> Talking about my design and development thought-process</h3>
<p>
  While writing is the communication form I've spent the most time practicing, occasionally, I like to 
  explain things in front of a camera. Here are three videos from a series I produced on DoneDone called 
  &ldquo;Real Code&rdquo; that go into small details of my UI, UX, and development thought-process.

  About 15 years ago, I curated a number of blog posts I had written over the prior decade and created a 
  web-based book about the life of a software developer. (Apparently, I love making web-based books!)
      I shopped it around for a year until the Pragmatic Bookshelf took a chance on it. It was published in 2012. 
    </p>
    <p>A few chapters from the book:</p>
