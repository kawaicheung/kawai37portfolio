<h2>Things written and spoken.</h2>
<p>
  I love that good communication is a core strength of every 37signals hire. 
  Though I wasn't forward-thinking enough to keep an archive of my
  most epic emails and Basecamp Classic threads, here are a few things I've written, spoken, and illustrated.

<h3><strong>Real Code Series:</strong> Talking through my design and development thought-process</h3>
<p>
  While writing is the communication form I've spent the most time practicing, occasionally, I like to 
  explain things in front of a camera. Here are three videos from a series I produced on DoneDone called 
  &ldquo;Real Code&rdquo; that go into small details of my UI, UX, and development thought-process.

  <strong>How do you store sort?</strong> Though this has to do more with server-side thinking, 
  my most popular video is one about how I store Kanban sort order in the database. This was a major
  technical hurdle I had to get through in the Kanban board I built for DoneDone.

    <p>
      About 15 years ago, I curated a number of blog posts I had written over the prior decade and created a 
      web-based book about the life of a software developer. (Apparently, I love making web-based books!)
      I shopped it around for a year until the <%= link_to "Pragmatic Bookshelf", "https://pragprog.com/titles/kcdc/the-developer-s-code/", target: "_blank" %> took a chance on it. It was published in 2012.

<h3><strong>The Stories of DoneDone:</strong> Tales of joy, fear, reservation and pride during the making of our issue tracker</h3>
<p>
  In 2017, as I was about to embark on DoneDone as a full-time job, I wrote a series of essays reflecting on 
  the first 8 years. This went beyond design and development and into other parts of building a product.

<h3>A piece on my full web design career</h3>
<p>
  Last year, I wrote a long piece on Medium, digging up all my past web work on the Wayback Machine. 
  I was writing it to no one but myself. But much to my surprise, it became a &ldquo;staff pick&rdquo; on Medium. 
  You can see my a lot of my pre-DoneDone work here as well.

  I hope what I've shared on these pages gives you a good sense of my work, joy for the craft,
  sense of aesthetics, thought-process, and excitement about this position at 37signals.
