<h2>Why 37signals is a great fit for me.</h2>
<p>
  In fact, for the past 15 years, I worked solely on one pretty large web-based product called DoneDone. 
  It's a task management and shared inbox tool I created in 2008 and.
  The build team was never more than 3 people, and for the past six years, it was, well, just me and my business partner. More on all of this later.

<p>
  I don't think of myself as a generalist. That feels like somone that knows a little about a lot. 
  I think I know a lot about a lot! All aspects of designing, building, and maintaining products deeply. 
</p>
<p>
  But, 25 years in, I'm ready to hone in on what I love the most. Whereas most might see this position as a stretch of skills, to me it would be
  a welcome focus. I love designing in code. I love coding things up. I love working with like-minded, talented people.

  We sold DoneDone in September of 2024.

<p>
  I think I can be a great teammate.

  We’re looking for a designer, not a decorator. A product builder, not a picture maker. A shipper, not a prototyper. 
  There’s plenty of the latter, but we’re after the former.

  Let me show you an example. For DoneDone, I spent about a month developing an easy way to
  help folks auto-forward their Gmail address into their DoneDone account.
